<b>Sodeztia</b>


Sodeztia is a DevSecOps tool created with the intention of speeding up deployment and teardown of Honeypot environments. The Honeypots are in Vagrant Environments coupled with Ansible as its provision for easy setup and deployment.

This code is the frontend Graphic User Interface (GUI) which operates the backend in which requires seperate setup from this system.

<b>Current Limitations:</b>
1. The system at present only deploys its Vagrant environment honeypots locally and not to external servers yet.
2. The system has no way to configure its logging server and must be hardcoded in the backend code.
